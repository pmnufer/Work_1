Viewing order

1. Page 1 overview
2. page 1 custom
  Using Dax custom date ranges can be predetermined.

  After selecting custom, the slicer changes to a range so the user can choose their own date range.
4. page 1 location
5. page 1 selected
6. page 2 overview
  Selecting the "D" image on the left side will allow a user to switch between the overview page and a detail page at the daily level. The slicers are synced so the slicers will keep the same selection regardless of which page you are on.
7. page 2 expanded
  Expanding the row in the matrix allows for even more detail to show for user interpretation.
8. page 3 overview
  Next selecting the "W" image on the left side will go a weekly breakdown of the first page rather than a daily breakdown.  
  Interations on this page are similar to the daily page where clicking the "W" again goes to a detailed page, the slicers in the header stay selected from daily, but the date slicer changes to a weekly breakdown.
  Similar actions would happen if "M" was selected for monthly page.
9. page 4 overview
  Every page from here on is a page in development, so no buttons have been added for their purpuse yet.
  This page can keep the same selections from slicers from previous pages but visualized different information that from the previous pages. 
  The "Label" column in the table match the "All" slicer in the header. If a selection was chose in that slicer, only that "Label" will show in the table and graph below.
10. page 4 expanded
  By expanding one of the rows in the matrix, you can see even more information
  Notice that Metic 3 is the x-axis and metric 2 is the y-axis.
  The green area is the target area for the points to be in.
11. page 5 overview
  This page was included to show actual vs planned, where planned was split between computer generated vs manually added plan records.
